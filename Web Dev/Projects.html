    <h4>Project 1</h4>
    <h4>Remote Controlled Land Mine Detector Using Zigbee Protocol</h4>
    Period:&nbsp;&nbsp;January 2011 - April 2011 <br>
    Team Size:&nbsp;&nbsp;4 <br>
    Role:&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Lead, Circuit designer and prototyping <br>
    Skills Used:&nbsp;&nbsp;Embedded C, Electronic Circuit Designing, PCB board Soldering <br>
    Tools Used:&nbsp;&nbsp;Zigbee XBee Module S2C 802.15.4, PIC 16F877A <br>
    Automation Testing tool:&nbsp;&nbsp;MP Lab IDE, Proteus Circuit Simulation. <br>
    Project Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;Embedded System <br>
    Place:&nbsp;&nbsp;Bharath University</p>
    <h4>Project Summary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This project is mainly applicable in the military application involves a rover, which will be traveling along different paths
        according to the command given by the user through Zigbee transceiver.
      </li>
      <li>The metal detecting sensor of the rover senses the metals and gives the warning signal to the PC if the type of metals used in
        explosives.</li>
      <li>The location (latitude and longitude)where the land mine is buried is captured by the GPS receiver and sent to the user's
        RCU(Remote Control Unit).</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Project 2</h4>
    <h4>Simulation of Generator Unit in Thermal Power Station Using LabVIEW Software</h4>
    <p>
      Period: February 2013 - April 2013 <br>
      Project Type:&nbsp;&nbsp; Graphical User Interfaces for Embedded Systems <br>
      Role:&nbsp;&nbsp; Embedded GUI designer <br>
      Technologies:&nbsp;&nbsp; LabVIEW <br>
      Skills Used:&nbsp;&nbsp; GUI Embedded GUI Programming <br>
      Team Size:&nbsp;&nbsp; Single <br>
      Place:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sathyabama University
    </p>
    <h4>Project Summary</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering Workbench (<a href="https://www.ni.com/en-in/shop/labview/labview-details.html">LabVIEW</a>) are widely used in industry for supervisory control and
        data acquisition of industrial processes.</li>
      <li>This paper describes the simulation of a system for laboratory-based thermal power plant generator setup using LabVIEW
        data logging and supervisory control (<a href="https://www.ni.com/en-in/shop/software/products/labview-datalogging-and-supervisory-control-module.html">DSC</a>) module.</li>
      <li>Using the input, output, and transfer function parameters, the simulation of the generator unit and alarm handling technique
        is achieved.</li>
      <li>This simulation results can be used for efficient use of coal burn to get higher throughput of power output from the
        generator in the thermal power plant.</li>
    </ul>
